            <h1>The Code Of Growth</h1>
            <img src="./theCodeOfGrowth.jpg" alt="Descripción" class="img4">
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>For this project, what was required was a poem in which we described a bit about our specialization . As the poem progressed, it had to describe the three years of 
                specialization, and it needed to have four stanzas. This work had to be done in pairs so we needed to separed the stanzas into the two of us and in the three years. 
                To properly describe the specialization, we had to take a trip to the past to include details that would make the poem special. It was hard to find those words that 
                would connect with each one's lived experiences. The poem begins with a dark, uncertain tone, which reflects how we felt at the start. By the end, it speaks of light 
                and peace, showing how we felt more secure as we neared the finish. Honestly, writing a poem was a good new experience, but also something that made us more aware of 
                what we've lived through. It also made us reflect on our thoughts and challenged us to write a poem, which isn't something we do every day.</p>

                <li> <strong> Dificulties </strong> </li>
                <p style="text-align: left;" > This assignment was one of the shortest we’ve had, but it still came with its challenges. One of the biggest struggles was not knowing how to write a 
                    good poem and adding that was about software. Specifically, about the three years that we have had been in the specialty. The task was to create a poem about our 
                    three years in the software specialty. Another difficulty was figuring out how to begin: Should the poem focus on the subjects we studied, or should it tell the 
                    story of our journey from start to finish. We decided to start by portraying it as a dark path that gradually became brighter over time. But this brought another 
                    challenge, how to demostrate those emotions effectively. It was tough finding the right words to make the poem meaningful and well written, which became our next 
                    dificulty. Making the lines rhyme while incorporating technical terms in a rhythmic way proved to be tricky. When we were nearly finished, we realized something 
                    new, some parts didn’t quite match the tone of the narrative or what we wanted to express, and fixing this took some time. Finally, we wrote it on decorated paper 
                    to give it an old-fashioned look. And so, despite all these difficulties, we arrived at the final result we have today.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: left;" >In this project, were used creative and communication skills. First, we needed to reflect on our experiences from each of the three years of the specialty. 
                    This helped us to know how to put some experiences into words. We also had to work in pairs, so teamwork and coordination were very important. Since each of us had to
                    write different stanzas, we needed to make sure the whole poem still felt complete. We used writing and editing skills to choose the right words to express emotions 
                    and ideas clearly. Creativity was important, especially when trying to connect each verse with personal experiences. It was also necessary to organize the structure 
                    and follow the instructions about the four stanzas. We learned to be patient and open to each other’s suggestions. These skills helped us finish a poem that showed both 
                    our memories and our growth.</p>
                
                <li> <string> Did you develop or improve any new skills? If so, how? </string></li>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Yes, I developed new skills, especially in creative writing. Before this, I had never written a full poem about 
                    personal experiences. At first, it was difficult to express emotions through words and make everything connect. I improved my ability to reflect, because I had to remember
                    how I felt during each year of the specialization. Working with a partner also helped me to put in practice communication and cooperation skills. We had to combine our 
                    styles and ideas in a way that made the poem sound like one voice. I also learned how to give rhythm and meaning to each line, even if it was short. Writing a poem was 
                    something completely different from what we usually do in class. It was a new way to tell our story and show how we changed. In the end, I felt more aware of my own 
                    learning process. </p>

            <h1>Software Sales Pitch</h1>
            <img src="./SWForDummies.png" alt="Descripción" class="img4">
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>For this project, we had to make a video about our specialty. The purpose of the video was to show what our specialty is like so that anyone who wanted to choose it would understand what it’s about. In our case, our group had to present it as a software sales pitch. This project had three stages. The first stage was to do a brainstorm to decide how we were going to make the video and what we would include. For the second stage, we had to write a script of what we were going to say in the video. In the script, we decided not to write exactly word by word the things we wanted to said because we felt that what we said might change on the day of the recording. The last stage was to record the video. First, we recorded the parts where we spoke directly to the camera so we could have them ready. The next step was to look for old projects to show the kind of work we’ve done over the three years of the specialty. Finally, we recorded the parts for the voice overs. To finish the project, we had to edit and put everything together to create the best version of the video.</p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong> Dificulties </strong> </li>
                   <p style="text-align: left;"> This project had several difficulties from beginning to end. At the start, it was hard to agree what things did we wanted to say in the video . Some of us had 
                    different ideas, so it took time to decide. Writing the script was only a bit complicated because we already knew want we wanted to say and we did not write exactly word 
                    by word so we were free to say things naturally while we recorded. We had to balance being natural and still keeping the information clear. On recording day, we were nervous
                    to speak in front of the camera. We also had to repeat some takes because of mistakes or background noise. Finding the old projects took longer than we expected. Another 
                    challenge was editing, especially matching the voice-overs with the images. In the end, it was hard work, but we managed to organize everything and finish the video on time.</p>
                
                <li><strong>SKills </strong></li>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">For this project, we used several skills that helped us complete the video. First, we used planning skills during doing the brainstorm stage to organize our ideas. 
                    We also practiced writing skills when writing the script. Communication and teamwork were important because we had to agree on what to include and what no. We used public 
                    speaking skills when talking to the camera, trying to sound confident and natural. During editing, we used basic video editing tools and learned to cut and mix clips. 
                    Creativity helped us choose how to present the specialty in a fun and clear way. We also used problem solving skills when something didn’t go as planned. Time management was 
                    important to finish before the deadline. We also used digital skills when working with images, voice overs, and transitions. All these skills made it possible to complete the 
                    project in the best way. </p>
                
               <li> <string> Did you develop or improve any new skills? If so, how? </string></li>
                   <p style="text-align: left;"> If so, how? Yes, I developed new skills while working on this video project. It was my first time organizing all needed to create a
                    video from beginning to end. I had to learn how to plan what to do first and what to leave for later. One of the hardest parts was deciding what to say in the video and how to
                    present the information in an interesting way. Even though I was only a little bit nervous while recording, it didn’t take us much time to film the speaking parts. I also practiced
                    being more clear and natural while talking on camera. I improved my teamwork because we had to agree on every step, like choosing scenes and editing. I also learned to stay organized
                    and keep track of the video parts we had already recorded. This helped me understand how important structure and time management are in media projects. In the end, I felt proud of
                    how much I learned during the process.</p>
