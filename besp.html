            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>For this project, what was required was a poem in which we described a bit about our specialization . As the poem progressed, it had to describe the three years of specialization, and it needed to have four stanzas. This work had to be done in pairs so we needed to separed the stanzas into the two of us and in the three years. To properly describe the specialization, we had to take a trip to the past to include details that would make the poem special. It was hard to find those words that would connect with each one's lived experiences. The poem begins with a dark, uncertain tone, which reflects how we felt at the start. By the end, it speaks of light and peace, showing how we felt more secure as we neared the finish. Honestly, writing a poem was a good new experience, but also something that made us more aware of what we've lived through. It also made us reflect on our thoughts and challenged us to write a poem, which isn't something we do every day.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Dificulties: This assignment was one of the shortest we’ve had, but it still came with its challenges. One of the biggest struggles was not knowing how to write a good poem and adding that was about software. Specifically, about the three years that we have had been in the specialty. The task was to create a poem about our three years in the software specialty. Another difficulty was figuring out how to begin: Should the poem focus on the subjects we studied, or should it tell the story of our journey from start to finish. We decided to start by portraying it as a dark path that gradually became brighter over time. But this brought another challenge, how to demostrate those emotions effectively. It was tough finding the right words to make the poem meaningful and well written, which became our next dificulty. Making the lines rhyme while incorporating technical terms in a rhythmic way proved to be tricky. When we were nearly finished, we realized something new, some parts didn’t quite match the tone of the narrative or what we wanted to express, and fixing this took some time. Finally, we wrote it on decorated paper to give it an old-fashioned look. And so, despite all these difficulties, we arrived at the final result we have today.</li>
