            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">This was the first website we made this year. It was used as a reintroduction to HTML and CSS. We created this site for an imaginary bakery, though in my
                 case I chose to base it on a real life bakery I know. We started by reviewing the basics and learning some additional things of CSS. The first elements we
                  created were to structure our  webpage. We picked colors, a name, and the aesthetic based on our personal preferences. We designed a functional navigation
                   bar that could be easily used in the future. Next, we created product cards to display each bakery item. These were a bit challenging to make them to stay
                    in the place and in the way we wanted. Each card showed the product's price, and the idea was to have selected items appear in a list that would calculate
                     the total cost. Finally, we added a rating section where users could give us 1-5 stars based on their experience with our shop.</p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong> Dificulties </strong> </li>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Honestly, I faced quite a few challenges with this website. First, it was hard remembering how to build each section especially getting back
                     into using CSS. As we progressed, my navbar wasn't looking how I wanted, and I spent way too much time adjusting it. The most time consuming part was the
                      product cards. Even though we copied them from Bootstrap, they wouldn't be in the position we wanted them. We spent ages editing them to look right. Then
                       came finding products for each card and setting their prices. After finishing with the cards, we created the experience rating system. Personally, this
                        was the toughest part I spend so much time trying to make it work exactly how I was looking it to work and be, but couldn't get it quite right. After
                         finally getting the rating system working, I implemented the product list which take it time mostly with reorganizing where it was gonna be everything
                          with that part added. Finally, I worked in the finishing touches and dedicated time to the responsive design which definitely tested my skills.</p>
                
                <li><strong>Skills </strong></li>
                    <p style="text-align: left;"> In this project, I used many different skills that I already knew or had reviewed. I used HTML to structure each part of the website, like the header, 
                    cards, and footer. CSS helped me with design choices such as colors, layout, and how everything looked overall. I also used some Bootstrap components to help 
                    build the product cards and navigation bar. Problem-solving was a big part of the project when things didn’t look right or work correctly. I used creativity to 
                    design the theme of the bakery, including the name and colors. I also practiced time management, especially when working on the rating system and finishing the
                    layout. I used basic logic skills when thinking about how to show the price and total of selected items. My attention to detail was useful when testing the layout
                    on different screen sizes. Finally, I used collaboration and feedback by asking classmates for help or suggestions during the process.</p>
                
                <li> <strong> Did you develop or improve any new skills? If so, how? </strong></li>
                    <p style="text-align: left;"> Yes, I definitely improved some skills while working on this site. I became more confident using CSS, 
                    especially when adjusting small details like spacing, borders, and alignment. At first, I struggled with positioning elements, but by the end I was much better
                    at it. I also improved in using Bootstrap, even though I had to adjust a lot of the code to make it work the way I wanted. Working on the product list helped me
                    practice how to structure things clearly for the user. The rating system made me think creatively and also showed me how important small design decisions are. I
                    learned how to better plan and organize content for a full webpage. I also learned how to make a website responsive, thing I did not know about before. I improved
                    my patience and focus by working through problems step by step. In the end, I felt proud of how far my design and coding skills had come since the beginning of the year.</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">This project was created as a challenge between the same specialty to see which webpage turned out best in terms of experience, code, and visuals.
                 In our case, our page didn't win first place but if I remember correctly, we came in second. The work was done in pairs, and each group's members 
                 were responsible for their page's aesthetic. There wasn't a predetermined style we had to follow, we could choose our own. For our design, we wanted 
                 something almost elegant, and as a landing page, we decided to showcase the attending artists in a carousel. For this event, we had to feature 
                 independent artists or emerging bands that would attract a young audience. We also needed to include a ticket section with information for the public,
                  where we added different ticket types with varying prices and details about what each included. Another required section was a map to show the event
                   location. It was really fun designing the page's looks, choosing the aesthetics, and selecting elements to make it unique. Since this was one of the
                    first websites we made this year, we only used CSS and HTML, with just a bit of JavaScript for the carousel we wanted on the landing page.</p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong> Dificulties </strong> </li>
                    <p style="text-align: left;"> Like with most projects, we faced several challenges with this one. At first, we struggled to find no very well-know artists since the
                     event's purpose was to promote new talent, and we did discover some great ones during this process. Another issue (not exactly a problem but time-consuming)
                      was choosing the perfect logo to represent our event. Then creating the tickets, our lack of experience made it hard to decide on prices and what
                       each ticket tier should include. During website development, our biggest time drain was finding high quality images of each the artists and bands.
                        Later, we faced issues with image dimensions not fitting properly. Our solution was to use Canva to resize everything to the same measures. The
                         next difficulty was getting the carousel arrows to work they wouldn't work properly and appeared misplaced. In conclusion, our biggest challenge
                          was implementing that landing page carousel.</p>
                
                <li><strong>Skills </strong></li>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">For this project, we used several skills that helped us build the website. First, we practiced our HTML and CSS knowledge to create the structure
                     and style of the page. We also used basic JavaScript to make the carousel work on the landing page. One of the main skills was teamwork, since we 
                     worked in pairs and had to make decisions together. We learned to use design tools like Canva to fix problems with image sizes and make everything 
                     look clean. We also improved our problem solving skills when we faced challenges with the carousel arrows and ticket section. Choosing the right visual
                      style for the event helped us understand more about UI and UX design. We had to use research skills to find new and independent artists to include on
                       the site. It also helped us get better at time management, because we had many tasks to finish. In general, this project helped us become more 
                       confident with web design and working as a team.</p>
                
                <li> <strong> Did you develop or improve any new skills? If so, how? </strong></li>
                    <p style="text-align: left;"> Yes, during this project I developed and improved several new skills, especially in Java and 
                    Bootstrap. Before this, I didn’t have much experience using Bootstrap, and the last time I used it was too long ago, but working on the website helped
                     me understand how to use its components to create a responsive and clean design faster. I learned how to use grids, buttons, cards, and navbars to 
                     make the layout look more professional. In Java, I improved my understanding of basic programming logic, like using loops, conditions, and methods 
                     to make the program more organized. I also learned how to connect Java with a simple database to store and show data. Solving problems in Java helped
                      me get better at debugging and testing my code. It was also the first time I focused on making a webpage look good on different screen sizes, which 
                      is something Bootstrap helped a lot with. Working with both tools gave me a better idea of how frontend and backend can work together. I now feel more
                       confident using Java for logic and Bootstrap for design. This project made me realize how important it is to keep learning new tools and practicing 
                       them in real projects.</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">For this project, we had to create a decision-based video game. The goal was to build a webpage that works as an interactive game where different scenarios
                 would appear based on the player's choices. Once again, we worked in pairs and had complete creative freedom over the visual style. We first started with 
                 a totally different story and visual but then we decided to changed to something that gave vibes of an old videogame. The final decision choose was something
                  with a Japanese pixel art aesthetic, even added background music, gave it a Japanese name, and carefully selected pixel art style images. The story we 
                  designed was short but entertaining, something enjoyable despite its brief duration. Building the webpage itself wasn't challenging at all, in fact, it
                   was really fun. This project let us practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We implemented new JavaScript features like using JSON files for decision making
                    and local Storage to save the progress the player made. The final result was incredibly satisfying, especially considering the difficulties we faced 
                    during development and all the constant changes we had to make along the way.</p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong> Dificulties </strong> </li>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Even though the project was fun, we also had a few difficulties along the way. At first, we started with a completely different story and
                     visual style, but later we decided to change everything. It was hard to agree on a final idea because we wanted something unique and we needed to start
                      over again. After some discussions, we chose a Japanese pixel art theme, which also meant finding or creating the right images took more time. Picking 
                      the background music and matching it with the game’s vibe was also a bit challenging. Another difficulty was organizing all the player decisions and 
                      connecting them to the correct scenes. We had to be very careful with the logic so the story made sense. Using JSON and localStorage was new for us, so 
                      it took time to test and fix errors. Even though we had to make many changes during development, the project turned out really well in the end. The best
                       reward was that most of our classmates enjoy it son we accomplish our goal.</p>
                
                <li><strong>Skills </strong></li> 
                    <p style="text-align: left;">In this project, we used many important skills to create a decision based video game on a webpage. It was worked with HTML and CSS to build the 
                    structure and style of the game. thing that made difficult to make the buttons that we wanted. With time passing and us not solving the button problem, 
                    we decided the best option was to use images for that part. We also used JavaScript to control the game logic and connect each player decision to a different
                     outcome. One of the new things we used was JSON, which helped organize the story paths and decisions in a clear way. We also used local Storage to save the
                      progress that user has made to the moment. This allowed the user to continue where they left off, which made the game more interactive. We worked in pairs,
                       so teamwork and communication were key to making everything work. Choosing a visual style also helped us improve our design and aesthetic skills. Overall,
                        this project helped us use both technical and creative skills at the same time.</p>
                
                <li> <strong> Did you develop or improve any new skills? If so, how? </strong></li> 
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Yes, I definitely learned and improved several skills during this project. One of the biggest improvements
                     was in JavaScript, especially using features like JSON and localStorage that I hadn’t used before. I learned how to read data from a JSON file to control the
                      decisions in the game, which was very useful. I also improved my logic and programming thinking, because the story had many branches and we had to plan each
                       one carefully. I learned more about how localStorage works and how to save the user’s choices so they don’t lose their progress. On the creative side, I improved
                        my ability to choose the right aesthetic style, including matching images and music. Also, I got involved with pixel art with the part of the problem with
                        the buttons and it was a new experience. It was also a good chance to practice how to organize a game idea into code. Finally, I got better at adapting to
                         changes, because we changed our concept in the middle of the project and still finished successfully. This made me feel more confident for future coding 
                         projects.</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">This project was focused on building a simple system that allows users to register new video games into a list. It was designed for users who are already logged
                 in, so we had to make sure that the content was protected and only visible to registered users. The main idea was to let the user fill out a form with information
                  about a video game, such as the title, category, and and check box to know if the user already finish the game or no. After the form was submitted, the data was
                   saved into a database. Then, the system would automatically take the user back to the main page, where they could see all the games listed, including the new
                    one. This project helped us understand how user input can be sent, processed, and stored safely. It also taught us how to manage user sessions, which is 
                    important for protecting private information. We practiced creating forms, connecting them to a database, and updating the content dynamically. Even though
                     the design was simple, it was a great experience for learning how the backend of a web application works.</p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong> Dificulties </strong> </li> 
                    <p style="text-align: left;">One of the biggest challenges we faced was making the table and buttons on the dashboard work correctly. We had issues where things just wouldn’t
                    function the way we expected. Sometimes, clicking the buttons wouldn’t do anything, or they would take us somewhere else. Fixing that part took more time than
                    we thought. There were also moments when the data didn’t appear as it should, which made testing harder. We knew something was wrong, but it wasn’t easy to figure
                    out where the problem was. The design part also gave us trouble when it came to aligning elements properly. At one point, the form didn’t behave the way we wanted
                    either. Other smaller problems came up here and there while connecting everything. It definitely took patience to solve it all and get it running.</p>
                
                <li><strong>Skills </strong></li>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">There were several important skills used to complete this project successfully. First, applied our knowledge of HTML and CSS to build and style the interface.
                    Used PHP to connect the form to the database and handle user sessions. With SQL, wrote queries to insert, update, and delete video game records. Used logic 
                    skills to handle user input, especially for checking if a game was marked as completed. Practiced using forms correctly, including text inputs and checkboxes. 
                    It also required problem solving when things didn’t go as planned. Worked with databases to store data the user enter and make it appear. Used  UI structure to 
                    organize the dashboard. Finally, applied security skills by protecting the content with session validation for logged in users only.</p>
                
                <li> <strong> Did you develop or improve any new skills? If so, how? </strong></li>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Yes, I developed and improved some new skills during this project. I got better at organizing small systems and 
                    understanding how to connect forms with databases. I practiced working with user sessions and keeping track of login information. It was one of the first times I included
                    features like editing and deleting content, which helped me learn a lot. I improved at fixing errors and figuring out why something wasn’t working as expected. I also
                    stayed patient and focused while testing different parts. My confidence in writing SQL and using it with forms grew. This project helped me see how the frontend and 
                    backend come together. I also improved in planning my steps before coding. In the end, the whole process gave me a clearer idea of how everything fits in a complete web system.</p>
